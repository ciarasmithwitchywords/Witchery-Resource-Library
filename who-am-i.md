Hi! I'm Ciara. I'm a Navy veteran, mom, wife, genderfae, pansexual, disabled with EDS and POTS, AuDHDer, editor, agent, writer, witch, and pagan. Lol. I like labels as you can tell. But mostly I'm a person who likes research, who likes bettering myself, and who likes helping others in numerous ways.

I've been practicing witchcraft since 2021 after the birth of my second daughter. I started with tarot reading and astrology. I then worked with the Norse Pantheon and was initiated as a Volva. At the time I wasn't ready for the path the Norse deities were hoping I would take and moved through different stages of my craft.

Herbalism is near and dear to my heart and the spiritual and medicinal properties of plants will constantly be added and updated as I learn more.

Astrology is also a fierce passion and I think would help many people to understand.

Currently (as of November, 2024) I work with Hecate and consider myself an Energy Witch (which I'll get into in the Why did I do this page).

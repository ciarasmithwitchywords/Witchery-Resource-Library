As I said in the Who am I? page, I'm an Energy Witch. What this means is that I work with and seek to understand the energy around me. I'm studying Reiki to help mine and other's energy alignment, but in further study, determined that wasn't enough.

See, everything around us has energy too. We're not individual pockets of energy. Everything is and has energy that can connect to all the other energies. And this extends beyond planet Earth! Which is why Astrology is important too, to see our connections to the universe around us!

Now there are amazing resources available, books, websites, that will tell you that this herb is related to this and this. This crystal connects to these energies. And those resources are great! I've used them in the research to do this.

But what I really wanted was a visual aid to allow you to see all of this. When you click on an herb, you will see the link to the connections. When you click on a tag like abundance, you'll see the herbs, crystals, deities, linked to abundance. I think this will help strengthen our spells, diversify our practice, and most importantly (to me) connect us further with the energies around us.

Now, I'm not saying I know everything!! If you see a mistake, I would love to know! Please email me at ciarasmith@witchandwords.com with the subject line "Library Correction" and let me know what I got wrong! If you'd like to request a new category that I haven't added, you can email with the subject "Library Request"

And if you would like to contribute knowledge, I would love that! Please email it with subject line "Library Contribution". I would love for this to be a collaborative project and will be sure to credit you with your contribution at the bottom of the new page.

If you appreciate what I've done here and would like to buy me a coffee (or tea!) you can do so here: https://ko-fi.com/ciarasmithwitchandwords

Thank you so mcuh for reading this far and I hope you enjoy this website!!
